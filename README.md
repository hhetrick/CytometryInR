### Motivation

"Cytometry in R" is a weekly mini-course being offered both in-person and online by the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource staff at the [University of Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cibr/core/umgccc_flow/). Its primary audience is for those with prior flow cytometry knowledge, who have limited previous experience with the programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

While many cytometry enthusiast express an interest in learning how to carry out flow cytometry analyses in R, they often do not know where to start. Additionally, many of the limited [existing resources](https://umgccfcss.github.io/BISCC_2025/Resources.html#cytometry-in-r) are focused towards users with intermediate bioinformatic skills, contributing to a greater barrier for entry for those just starting out. Our motivation in offering this mini-course tailored towards beginners is to make the learning journey smoother than the one we ourselves experienced. 


### Rationale

While designing the course, we kept the following concepts in mind:

- Beginning coders benefit both by having detailed examples that they can initially work through on their own time, as well as less defined problems that through troubleshooting enable the acquisition of the thought-process and skills needed for coding. 

- Some topics will take individuals a longer time to fully grasp. Providing a format and resources that enable being able to revisit the material multiple times is incredibly helpful. Likewise, life is busy, and missing a workshop session is highly probable. If this happens, it shouldn't make or break the ability of the individual to understanding the rest of the course. 

- Consistency is key, and being able to apply what you are learning to your own datasets, files, and questions of interest helps achieve this. 

### Cost

Is there a cost to participate? No, it's absolutely free! Is there a catch? Yes, you learn R, and may wind up with strong feelings about flowframes vs. cytoframes. This is also our first year offering this course, so we will sporadically ask you to fill out a feedback form to help us improve.
